  - add retry logic

# Feature: S3 Versioning Support
  allow restore objects from S3 at a given time using `aws s3api list-object-versions` and `aws s3api get-object`
  
  aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <bocket-name> --encoding-type url --max-items 1000 --starting-token <nextToken of prev result>
  
# Feature: Allow user to review and revise metadata before actual restore
  1st step: generate file structure (folder hierarchy and original file names with json suffix) holding metadata about each files versions (and delete markers) and flag the version to be downloaded
  2nd step: user may review file structure and metadata of files to be restored and potentially delete files or modify metadata to define version to be retrieved
  3rd step: restore from s3 based on previously generated (and revised) metadata
